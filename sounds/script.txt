Hello guys, today we're gonna talk about bully.
Bully means annoying someone for no reason, just for fun, and this is wrong behaviour.
let's take a look about it.
we need to avoid this behaviour from our society, because it's harm our children, and make them fear, lonely and disappointed.


the school bell was fired but molly still here.
molly is one of the student that get bullied from the others.
they took her school backpack and her lunch so she missed the math class.
molly doesn't have friends and she suffer from bullied.


Go to hell john,you're loseeeeer and nobody loves you.

John,he is one of the students that get bullied from George.
John everyday attends his classes, get an A+ at the subjects he studies.
George is the opposite of John,he didn't attend any classes.
He fails in his subjects at school.
when exam starts, George ask john to cheat him but john refused, sothat john suffer from bullied.

finally we need to be clear with bullying, we need to prevent this behaviour from spreading.
